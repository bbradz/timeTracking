# TimeTracking! 🗓️

For the past 6 months I have been counting and documenting every 30 minutes of every single day (in Google Sheets for the 1st two months and Excel these last 4) basic information on how I have been spending my time. While the structuring of how much information I collect and how it is stored is something I'm very interested in expanding upon after this project when I have more robust methods for storing the information, up until now I have been storing for every day for every 30 minute slot of that day:

  - Which basic category of time usage, from 30 which have organically been found over time, I was occupying
  - How much $$ has been Δ
  - What basic social scenario I was in, from 10 (another feature which I may enhance in the future with additional coding projects)
  - And a written description of what I was doing during every timeslot. 

I've also tracked information relating to:
  - Health habits 🏃
  - Travel ✈️
  - Eating out 🧑‍🍳
  - Pages read 📖

I intend to use this repositiory to code up a way of converting that infromation from Excel into an SQL database which can be used to better access and process that information for purposes of self-analysis and sheer interest in understanding the trends in the data I've been collecting about my life. I will teach myself about:

1. How SQL functions
2. How to write Excel scripts in python
3. Using pandas, numpy, and matplotlib in order to visualize said information

Optimally, at the end of this project I will be able to put together a final *report* presenting the information about these last 6 months and be able to not only draw some interesting information which can help me improve as a person in the ways I want to improve but also teach me some interesting stuff about Data Analysis and Databases along the way :)

Wish me luck,
